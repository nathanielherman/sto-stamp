STAMP for STO

To build: cd stamp-0.9.10/benchmark-you-want-to-run
"make -f Makefile.seq" to make the sequential version of the tests, 
"make -f Makefile.stm" to make the STM version of the tests (this requires building tl2 first)
Then see README in that directory for what options to use for the benchmark.
